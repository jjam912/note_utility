James Oglethorpe (1733): This person was given a royal charter for a proprietary colony, and this person led a group of philanthropists to form Georgia's first settlement, Savannah. He eventually would give up on Georgia and let the British government take it over, leading to Georgia becoming a royal colony.

Metacom: This person was a chief of the Wampanoags, known to the colonists as King Philip.
King Philip's War (1675-1676): This is when King Philip united many tribes in southern New England against the English settlers, who were constantly encroaching on the American Indians' lands, and declared war. This war ended when King Philip was killed, and this ended most American Indian resistance in New England.

Mayflower Compact (1620): This was a document that pledged Pilgrims to make decisions by the will of the majority. This was an early form of colonial self-government and rudimentary written constitution.
Virginia House of Burgesses: This was the first representative assembly in America

(Tobacco was the original good, but the list eventually grew).
Dominion of New England (1685-1686): This was created when King James II combined New York, New Jersey, and the various New England colonies into a single unit. He did this because he was determined to increase royal control over the colonies by combining them into larger administrative units and doing away with their representative assemblies
Sir Edmund Andros: This person was sent from England to serve as the governor of the Dominion of New England. He was instantly unpopular because he levied taxes, limited town meetings, and revoked land titles.

Each individual who expressed deep penitence could be saved by God's grace, but the souls who paid no heed to God's commandments would suffer eternal damnation.
Sectarian: This category of colleges promoted the doctrines of a particular religious group. The first one was Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1636), in order to give candidates for the ministry a proper theological and scholarly education.

Huguenots: This is another way of saying "French Protestant"

Hereditary aristocracy: This is the social system in Europe, where, with nobility, one would inherit special privileges, while masses of hungry poor had nothing.
John Peter Zenger: This person was a New York editor and publisher, and was brought to trial on a charge of libel(ously criticizing New York's royal governor).
Andrew Hamilton: This person was the lawyer for John Peter Zenger, and argued that while Zenger violated the law, he told the truth. In addition, he set the precedent for colonial rebellion by telling the juries that this is their chance to change American law to be different than English law.
Enlightenment (1700s): This was a European movement in literature and philosophy century. The leaders of this movement believed that the "darkness" of past ages could be corrected by the use of human reason in solving most of humanity's problems.
John Locke; Two Treatises of Government: This person was a 17th century English philosopher and political theorist. He wrote this book, which reasoned that while the state (the government) is supreme, it is bound to follow "natural laws" based on the rights that people have simply because they are human. He argued that sovereignty ultimately resides with the people rather than the state. Furthermore, he said that citizens had a right and an obligation to revolt against whatever government failed to protect their rights.

~Period 3: 1754-1800

~~Chapter 4: Imperial Wars and Colonial Protest, 1754-1774

Stamp Act Congress (1765): This was a meeting that consisted of 9 colonies, called by James Otis to protest the Stamp Act. It took place in New York, and they resolved that only their own elected representatives had the legal authority to approve taxes.
Sons and Daughters of Liberty: This was formed as a result of the Stamp Act Congress, and was a secret society organized for the purpose of intimidating tax agents. Members of this society sometimes destroyed revenue stamps and tarred and feathered revenue officials.

John Dickinson; "Letters From a Pennsylvania Farmer" (1767-1768): These letters wrote that Parliament could regulate commerce but argued that because duties were a form of taxation, they could not be levied on the colonies without the consent of their representative assemblies. This person argued that the idea of no taxation without representation was an essential principle of English law.
Samuel Adams; James Otis; Massachusetts Circular Letter (1768): These two people wrote this letter, which urged the various colonies to petition Parliament to repeal the Townshend Acts. British officials in Boston ordered the letter retracted, threatened to dissolve the legislature, and increased the number of British troops in Boston. This caused colonists to boycott British goods, and merchants to increase their smuggling activities.
Boston Massacre: This was when a crowd of colonists in Boston harassed the guards near the customs house. The guards fired into the crowd, killing 5 people, including an African American, Crispus Attucks. The soldiers were defended by colonial lawyer John Adams.
Committees of Correspondence (1772): These were committees that would regularly exchange letters about suspicious or potentially threatening British activities.
Gaspee (1772): This was a British customs ship that had caught several smugglers. One day, it ran aground off the shore of Rhode Island. Seizing their opportunity to destroy the hated vessel, a group of colonists disguised as American Indians, ordered the British crew ashore and then set fire to the ship.

Whigs: This was the dominant political party in Parliament, and they wanted the American colonies to bear more of the cost of maintaining the British Empire.
Salutary neglect: This is a policy where Britain exercised little direct control over the colonies and had generally allowed its navigation laws regulating colonial trade to go unenforced.
Lord Frederick North: The new prime minister that urged Parliament to repeal the Townshend Acts because they damaged trade and generated a disappointingly small amount of revenue.

Pontiac; Pontiac's Rebellion: This was when this Indian Chief led a major attack against colonial settlements on the western frontier. The American Indians were angered by the growing westward movement of European settlers onto their land and by the British refusal to offer gifts as the French had done. This rebellion destroyed forts and settlements from New York to Virginia. The British sent regular British troops to put down this rebellion, rather than relying on colonial forces to retaliate.
Proclamation of 1763: This was an effort to stabilize the western frontier, and is when the British government prohibited colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains.

Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) (1754): This war between Britain and France began when the French built a chain of forts in the Ohio River Valley to halt the westward growth of the British colonies. Hoping to stop the French, the governor of Virginia sent a small militia under Colonel George Washington. Washington accidentally killed the French ambassador Jumonville in the Jumonville affair. This caused George Washington to create Fort Necessity, a tiny fort. However, Washington was overwhelmed and forced to surrender and sign a treaty that said that George Washington was guilty of starting the war.
Albany Plan of Union (1754): This plan was developed by Benjamin Franklin and provided for an intercolonial government and a system for recruiting troops and collecting taxes from the various colonies for their common defense. However, each colony was too jealous of its own taxation powers to accept the plan, and the plan never took effect.
Edward Braddock: This was a general of the colonies in the French and Indian War that was defeated near Ft. Duquesne.
William Pitt: This was the British prime minister during the Seven Years' War. He concentrated the government's military strategy on conquering Canada, eventually taking over Quebec with General James Wolfe (1759), and Montreal (1760).
Peace of Paris (1763): This treaty gave Great Britain both French Canada and Spanish Florida. France gave up to Spain its huge western territory, Louisiana, and claims west of the Mississippi River in compensation for Spain's loss of Florida. With this treaty, the British extended their control of North America, and French power on the continent virtually ended.

Sugar Act (Revenue Act) (1764): This act placed duties on foreign sugar and certain luxuries. Its chief purpose was to raise money for the crown, and a companion law also provided for stricter enforcement of the Navigation Acts to stop smuggling.
Quartering Act (1765): This act required the colonists to provide food and living quarters for British soldiers stationed in the colonies.
Stamp Act (1765): This act required that revenue stamps be placed on most printed paper in the colonies, including all legal documents, newspapers, pamphlets, and advertisements, and was an effort to raise funds to support British military forces in the colonies. This was the first direct tax collected from those who used the goods.
Declaratory Act (1766): This act asserted that Parliament had the right to tax and make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." This policy would soon lead to renewed conflict between the colonists and the British government.
Townshend Acts (1767): This act enacted new duties to be collected on colonial imports of tea, glass, and paper. It also required that the revenues raised be used to pay crown officials in the colonies, thus making them independent of the colonial assemblies that had previously paid their salaries. This also provided for the search of private homes for smuggled goods.
Writs of Assistance: This was what was needed to conduct a search through private homes, rather than a judge's warrant permitting a search only of a specifically named property.
Tea Act (1773): This act made the price of the British East India Company's tea cheaper than that of smuggled Dutch tea. Many colonists still refused to buy the tea because that would recognize Parliament's right to tax the colonies.
Boston Tea Party (1773): This was when Bostonians disguised themselves as American Indians, boarded the British ships, and dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor. While many applauded this as a justifiable defense of liberty, others thought the destruction of private property was far too radical.
Coercive Acts (Intolerable Acts) (1774): There were four of these acts, directed mainly at punishing the people of Boston and Massachusetts and bringing the dissidents under control. The fourth law (no name) expanded the Quartering Act to enable British troops to be quartered in private homes. It applied to all colonies.
Port Act (1774): This act closed the port of Boston, prohibiting trade in and out of the harbor until the destroyed tea was paid for. This was the first Coercive act.

~~Chapter 5: The American Revolution and Confederation

Radicals: This was the radical faction during the pre-revolutionary war and included Patrick Henry (Vir), Samuel Adams (Mass), and John Adams (Mass).
Moderates: This faction during the pre-revolutionary war included George Washington (Vir) and John Dickinson (Penn)
Conservatives: This was the conservative faction that favored a mild statement of protest and included John Jay (NY), and Joseph Galloway (Penn).

First Continental Congress (1774): This was a convention in Philadelphia, and its purpose was to respond to what the delegates viewed as Britain's alarming threats to their liberties. Most Americans had no desire for independence, and simply wanted to protest parliamentary infringements of their rights and restore the relationship with the crown that had existed before the Seven Years' War. The delegates agreed to meet again in May 1775 if colonial rights were not recognized.
Galloway Plan of Union (1774): This was a plan similar to the Albany Plan of 1754, that would have reordered relations with Parliament and formed a union of the colonies within the British empire. This plan failed to pass by only one vote.
Suffolk Resolves (1774): This was a statement originally issued by Massachusetts, and called for the immediate repeal of the Intolerable Acts and for colonies to resist them by making military preparations and boycotting British goods.
Declaration and Resolves (Declaration of Rights and Grievances) (1774): This was a petition that urged the king to make right colonial grievances and restore colonial rights. This was backed by moderate delegates, and recognized Parliament's authority to regulate commerce
Continental Association (1774): This was a network of committees to enforce the economic sanctions of the Suffolk Resolves.
Second Continental Congress (1775): This was a meeting in Philadelphia where delegates from New England thought the colonies should declare their independence, while another group, mainly from the middle colonies, hoped the conflict could be resolved by negotiating a new relationship with Great Britain.
Olive Branch Petition (1775): This was sent by delegates at the Second Continental Congress (1775) to King George III, in which they pledged their loyalty and asked the king to intercede with Parliament to secure peace and the protection of colonial rights.

Declaration of the Causes and Necessities for Taking Up Arms (1775): This declaration called on the colonies to provide troops. It appointed George Washington as the commander-in-chief of the new colonial army and they were sent to Boston to lead the Massachusetts militia and volunteer units from other colonies.
Thomas Jefferson; Declaration of Independence (1776): This person, along with four other delegates, wrote this declaration, which listed specific grievances against George III's government and also expressed the basic principles that justified revolution. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia provoked this to happen after delivering his resolution.
George Washington: This person was the 1st president of the United States

Land Ordinance of 1785: This was a policy for surveying and selling western lands. It provided for setting aside one section of land in each township for public education.
Northwest Ordinance of 1787: This was a law that set the rules for creating new states. This granted limited self-government to the developing territory and prohibited slavery in the region.

Paul Revere; William Dawes (1775): These two people warned that a large force, led by General Thomas Gage, were being sent to seize colonial military supplies in the town of Concord.
Lexington: This was the place of the first skirmish of the American Revolution. Americans were forced to retreat under heavy British fire and eight Americans were killed.
Concord: This was the destination of General Thomas Gage and he succeeded in destroying some military supplies. However, on the way back, his soldiers were attacked by hundreds of militiamen firing at them from stone walls. The British suffered 250 casualties and also considerable humiliation at being so badly mauled by "amateur" fighters.
Battle of Bunker Hill (1775): This was a true battle fought between Americans and the British on the outskirts of Boston. Americans fortified Breed's Hill while a British force attacked the Americans' position and managed to take the Hill. Even though the British won, this was seen as a win for Americans because they succeeded in inflicting heavy losses on the attacking British army.
Battle of Saratoga (1777): This was a turning point for the American revolutionaries in upstate New York. It was won when General John Burgoyne marched from Canada to link up with other forces from the west and south. Their objective was to cut off New England from the rest of the colonies. But, Burgoyne was cut off and attacked by troops commanded by American generals Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold, forcing Burgoyne to surrender. This was more important in the diplomatic result, because after hearing about the American victory, France joined in the war against Britain to try to weaken England, France's traditional foe. A year later, Spain and Holland would also enter the war against Britain. The French alliance proved a decisive factor in the American struggle for independence because it widened the war and forced the British to divert military resources away from America.
George Rogers Clark (1778-1779): This General led the Patriots and captured a series of British forts in the Illinois country to gain control of parts of the vast Ohio territory.
Battle of Yorktown (1781): This was the last major battle of the Revolutionary War. Strongly supported by French naval and military forces, Washington's army forced the surrender of a large British army commanded by General Charles Cornwallis.
Articles of Confederation (1777, 1781): This was the first constitution for the United States as a nation, written by John Dickinson. It gave Congress the power to wage war, make treaties, send diplomatic representatives, and borrow money. However, Congress did not have the power to regulate commerce or to collect taxes. To finance any of its decisions, the congress had to rely upon taxes voted by each state. Neither did the government have executive power to enforce its laws.

Prohibitory Act (1775): This act declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion. Later, Parliament would forbid all trade and shipping between Britain and the colonies.
Treaty of Paris (1783): This was the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War. It provided (1) Britain would recognize the existence of the United States as an independent nation. (2) The Mississippi River would be the western boundary of that nation. (3) Americans would have fishing rights off the coast of Canada. (4) Americans would pay debts owed to British merchants and honor Loyalist claims for property confiscated during the war.

Thomas Paine; Common Sense: This person wrote this pamphlet that argued that the colonies should become independent states and break all political ties with the British monarchy. He argued that it was illogical for a large continent to be ruled by a small and distant island and for people to pledge allegiance to a king whose government was corrupt and whose laws were unreasonable.
Patriots: These were the 40 percent of the colonial population that actively participated in the struggle against Britain in the American Revolution. Most came from the New England states and Virginia, but most of the soldiers were reluctant to travel outside their own region. They would serve in local militia units for short periods, leave to work their farms, and then return to duty.
Loyalists (Tories): These were the 20-30 percent of the colonial population that sided with the British during the American Revolution. They supplied British soldiers with arms and food, and joined in raiding parties that pillaged revolutionist homes and farms.
Valley Forge (1777-1778): This was the place that Washington's troops suffered through a severe winter in Pennsylvania. However, most of his troops were trained by Prussian General Baron Von Steuben and thus were better military fighters.
Abigail Adams: This person was the wife of John Adams and "desired [he] would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors".
Deborah Sampson: This woman passed as a man and served as a soldier in the American Revolutionary War.
Mary McCauley (Molly Pitcher): This woman fought in the American Revolutionary War, taking her husband's place at the Battle of Monmouth.
Daniel Shays; Shays' Rebellion (1786-1787): This person was a Massachusetts farmer and Revolutionary War veteran, and he led other farmers in this uprising against high state taxes, imprisonment for debt, and lack of paper money. The rebel farmers stopped the collection of taxes and forced the closing of debtors' courts. When this person attempted to seize weapons from the Springfield armory, the state militia of Massachusetts broke this rebellion.

~~Chapter 6: The Constitution and the New Republic, 1787-1800

Federalists: These were supporters of the Constitution and its strong federal government. These were most common along the Atlantic Coast and in the large cities. This eventually became a party that supported Hamilton and his financial program. The party was centered in the northeastern states and advocated the growth of federal power.
Anti-Federalists: These were opposers of the Constitution. These people tended to be small farmers and settlers on the western frontier.
The Federalist Papers: These were a series of highly persuasive essays written for a New York paper by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. There were a total of 85 essays, and they presented cogent reasons for believing in the practicality of each major provision of the Constitution.
Bill of Rights: This was added to the Constitution to gain the support of Anti-Federalists. It added the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, listing people's rights.
1st Amendment: This gave people the freedom of speech, religion, press, the right to peaceably assemble, and petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
2nd Amendment: This gave people the right to keep and bear arms.
3rd Amendment: This protected the people from the government allowing soldiers to stay in civilian homes without the consent of the Owner unless it is during a time of war.
4th Amendment: This protected people from being searched and seized unreasonably.
5th Amendment: This allowed people the right to a grand jury,  remain silent, and stopped double jeopardy from happening, guaranteed rights of citizens to be preserved, and required the government to compensate citizens when it takes private property for public use.
6th Amendment: This guaranteed the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury, to know who your accusers are and what they charged you for, and the right to a lawyer .
7th Amendment: This guaranteed a trial by jury in civil cases in the federal government, and does not allow a court to overturn a jury's findings of fact.
8th Amendment: This stopped the federal government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishment.
9th Amendment: This ensured that the Bill of Rights was not seen as granting the people of the United States only the specific rights it addressed.
10th Amendment: This said that the powers not provided by the Constitution go to the states or the people.

Washington's Farewell Address: This was a message by President Washington, and it spoke about policies and practices that he considered unwise. He warned Americans (1) not to get involved in European affairs, (2) not to make "permanent alliances" in foreign affairs, (3) not to form political parties, and (4) not to fall into sectionalism.
Alien and Sedition Acts (1798): These were three separate acts that the Federalists passed to try to restrict their political opponents during the French Revolution.
Naturalization Act (1798): This act increased from 5 to 14 the years required for immigrants to qualify for U.S. citizenship.
Alien Acts (1798): This act authorized the president to deport aliens considered dangerous and to detain enemy aliens in time of war.
Sedition Act (1798): This act made it illegal for newspaper editors to criticize either the president or Congress and imposed fines or imprisonment for editors who violated the law.
Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions (1799): These laws declared that the states had entered into a "compact" in forming the national government, and, therefore, if any act of the federal broke the compact, a state could nullify the federal law.

Hamilton's Financial Plan (1791): This was a plan for putting U.S. finances on a stable foundation. It's three parts were (1) Pay off the national debt at face value and have the federal government assume the war debts of the states. (2) Protect the young nation's "infant" (new and developing) industries and collect adequate revenues at the same time by imposing high tariffs on imported goods. (3) Create a national bank for depositing government funds and printing banknotes that would provide the basis for a stable U.S. currency. However, to get Jefferson's support, the nation's capital had to be moved to the South, which would later be named Washington, D.C..
National bank: This was created by Hamilton's Financial Plan (1791), and created controversy over whether it was constitutional. Alexander Hamilton took a broad view of the Constitution, arguing that the document's "necessary and proper" clause authorized Congress to do whatever was necessary to carry out its enumerated powers. Jefferson, on the other hand, argued that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to create this.

Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794): This was a battle between Americans and American Indians, where General Anthony Wayne defeated the Confederacy tribes in northern Ohio. Americans were suspicious that Britain was supplying the American Indians with arms and encouraging them to attack the "intruding" Americans.
Treaty of Greenville (1795): This was signed by the chiefs of defeated American Indians, in which they surrendered claims to the Ohio Territory and promised to open it up to settlement.
Public Land Act (1796): This act established orderly procedures for dividing and selling federal lands at reasonable prices.

Mt. Vernon Conference (1785): This was a conference at George Washington's home to review what could be done about the country's inability to overcome critical problems. Representatives from Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania agreed to hold further discussions at a later meeting in Maryland, at which all the states might be represented.
Annapolis Convention (1786): Only five states sent delegates to this convention. After discussing ways to improve commercial relations among the states, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton persuaded the others that another convention should be held in Philadelphia for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.
Constitutional Convention (1787): This was a convention that called upon all 13 states to send delegates to Philadelphia "for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation." Only Rhode Island, not trusting the other states, refused to send delegates.
Checks and balances: This is a system such that the power of each branch would be limited by the powers of the others.
Virginia Plan (1787): This plan favored large states, and said that larger states should have proportionally more representatives in Congress than smaller states.
New Jersey Plan (1787): This plan favored smaller states, and called for equal number of representatives in Congress for every state.
Connecticut Plan; Great Compromise (1787): This compromise, made by Roger Sherman, provided for a two-house Congress. In the Senate, states would have equal representation, but in the House of Representatives, each state would be represented according to the size of its population.
Three-fifths Compromise (1787): This compromise counted each enslaved individual as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of determining a state's level of taxation and representation. It also decided to guarantee that slaves could be imported for at least 20 years longer, until 1808. This could be abolished by Congress at any time.
Commercial Compromise (1787): This compromise allowed Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce including placing tariffs (taxes) on foreign imports, but it prohibited placing taxes on any exports.
Electoral college system (1787): This system assigned each state to a number of electors equal to the total of that state's representatives and senators. This system was instituted because the delegates feared that too much democracy might lead to mob rule.

Judiciary Act (1789): This act established a Supreme Court with one chief justice and five associate justices. This highest court was empowered to rule on the constitutionality of decisions made by state courts. The act also provided for a system of 13 district courts and three circuit courts of appeals.
Whiskey Rebellion (1794): This was a revolt of a group of farmers who refused to pay the federal excise tax on whiskey that was raised by Alexander Hamilton. Washington responded to this crisis by federalizing 15,000 state militiamen and placing them under the command of Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton succeeded in crushing the rebellion with almost no bloodshed, which was seen as a victory for the new government.
Democratic-Republican party: This was a party that supported Jefferson and tried to elect candidates in different states who opposed Hamilton's program. Most of these people were from the southern states and on the western frontier and argued for states' rights.
John Adams: This person was the second president of the United States, Federalist, and his Vice President was Thomas Jefferson.
Revolution of 1800: This was the change from Federalist to Democratic-Republican control peacefully.

Proclamation of Neutrality (1793): This was created because President Washington did not believe that America was strong enough to engage in a European war. He issued this to avoid conflict, causing Jefferson to resign from his cabinet.
"Citizen" Genet: This person was the French minister to the United States, and he broke all the normal rules of diplomacy by appealing directly to the American people to support the French cause. This caused him to be recalled by the French government, but he stayed in the United States, married and became a U.S. citizen.
John Jay; Jay Treaty (1794): This person was sent on a mission to talk Britain out of its offensive practice of searching and seizing American ships and impressing seamen into the British navy. The effect was this treaty, in which Britain agreed to evacuate its posts on the U.S. western frontier, but said nothing about the impressment issue.
Pinckney Treaty (1795): This person negotiated this treaty with Spain, in which Spain agreed to open the lower Mississippi River and New Orleans to American trade. The right of deposit was granted to Americans so that they could transfer cargoes in New Orleans without paying duties to the Spanish government. Spain further agreed to accept the U.S. claim that Florida's northern boundary should be at the 31st parallel (not north of that line, as Spain had formerly insisted).
XYZ affair: This was when President John Adams sent a delegation to Paris to negotiate with the French government because many Americans were angered by reports that U.S. merchant ships were being seized by French warships and privateers. 3 of French ministers requested bribes as the basis for entering negotiations, and American delegates indignantly refused. This caused many Americans to clamor for war against France with their slogan "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute".

~Period 4: 1800-1848

~~Chapter 7: The Age of Jefferson, 1800-1816

Thomas Jefferson: This person was the 3rd president of the United States
Louisiana Purchase (1803): This was when President Thomas Jefferson bought the land up to the Mississippi River from Napoleon because (1) Napoleon needed to concentrate French resources on fighting England and (2) a rebellion led by Toussaint l'Ouverture against French rule on the island of Santo Domingo had resulted in heavy French losses. Napoleon needed funding for the war against Britain, and offered to sell this territory for $15 million.
War hawks: Led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, these are the congressman who want war with Britain because war with Britain would be the only way to defend American honor, gain Canada, and destroy American indian resistance on the frontier.
Tecumseh; Prophet: These two indians, one being a warrior and the other a religious leader, attempted to unite all of the tribes east of the Mississippi river.
William Henry Harrison: This person was the governor of the Indiana Territory, and called upon by white settlers to take aggressive action. He would also become the 9th president of the United States
Battle of Tippecanoe (1811): In this battle, William Henry Harrison destroyed the Shawnee headquarters and put an end to Tecumseh's efforts to form an Indian confederacy.
John Marshall: This person was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He held his post for 34 years, in which time he exerted as strong an influence on the Supreme Court as Washington exerted on the presidency. His decisions in many landmark cases generally strengthened the central government, often at the expense of states' rights.
Judicial review: This is the power of the Supreme Court to decide whether an act of Congress or of the president was allowed by the Constitution. The Supreme Court could now overrule actions of the other two branches of the federal government
Marbury v. Madison (1803): This court case was caused by Secretary of State James Madison not delivering commissions to the "midnight justices". However, one justice sued for his commission, saying that he had a right to his commission. John Marshall ruled that according to the Judiciary Act (1789), the justice had the right to his commission, but the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional because it gave the Supreme Court more power than the Constitution allowed. Therefore, the justice would not receive his commission.
"Quids": This was the old Democratic-Republicans, and they accused Jefferson of abandoning Democratic-Republican principles. These people did not like the War of 1812 and thought it was just a fight for more land.
Federalist Conspiracy (1804): This is when Aaron Burr formed a secret political pact with some radical New England Federalists. He planned to win the governorship of New York in 1804, unite that state with the New England states, and then lead this group of states to secede from the nation. This conspiracy failed when Hamilton was elected in the New York Election.
Burr Conspiracy (1806): This is when Aaron Burr made a plan to take Mexico from Spain and possibly unite it with Louisiana under his rule. Jefferson ordered Burr's arrest, and trial for treason, but John Marshall acquitted Burr, basing its decision on Marshall's narrow definition of treason and the lack of witnesses to any "overt act" by Burr.
Hartford Convention (1814): This was a convention where the New England states threatened to secede from the Union. New England radical Federalists hated the War of 1812, so they urged that the Constitution be amended so that there must be a two-thirds vote of both houses for any future declaration of war.
Barbary war (1801-1805): This was when President Jefferson decided to stop paying ransom to African nations as previous presidents did. He sent the U.S. Navy to the Mediterranean and fought with Tripoli. Although the American navy did not achieve a decisive victory, it did gain some respect and also offered a measure of protection to U.S. vessels trading in Mediterranean waters.
Impressment: This is the British practice of capturing U.S. sailors who it claimed were British citizens and forcing them to serve in the British navy.
Chesapeake-Leopard affair (1807): This is when the British warship Leopard fired on the U.S. warship Chesapeake off a few miles off the coast of Virginia. Anti-British feeling ran high, and many Americans demanded war. Jefferson, however, resorted to diplomacy and economic pressure as his response to the crisis.
Embargo Act (1807): This act prohibited American merchant ships from sailing to any foreign port. This backfired and brought a devastating economic hardship to the United States than to Britain.
James Madison: This person was the 4th president of the United States, and was previously the Secretary of State for President Jefferson.
Nonintercourse Act (1809): This act tried to end the economic hardship for the U.S. while maintaining U.S.'s rights as a neutral nation. It allowed trade with all foreign nations besides Britain and France.
Macon's Bill No. 2 (1810): This bill was created when Madison made proposition to trade with either Britain or France if they formally agreed to respect their neutral trading rights at sea, and then the United States would prohibit trade with that nation's foe. France jumped on this opportunity, but Madison soon found out that Napoleon had no intention of fulfilling his promise.
War of 1812: This war was declared because of British delays in meeting U.S. demands over neutral rights combined with political pressures from the War Hawks. Ironically, the British government had agreed to suspend its naval blockade by this time.

"Old Ironsides": This was a U.S. warship that raised American morale by defeating and sinking a British ship off the coast of Nova Scotia. American privateers, motivated by both patriotism and profit, captured numerous British merchant ships.
Battle of Lake Erie (1813); Oliver Hazard Perry: This was the most important naval battle in the war of 1812 because it kept the British navy out of the north. This captain, declared victory with "We have met the enemy and they are ours."
Battle of the Thames River (1813): This was a win for General William Henry Harrison, in which Tecumseh was killed.
Thomas Macdonough; Battle of Lake Champlain (1814): This was when this general defeated a British fleet in the war of 1812. As a result, the British had to retreat and abandon their plan to invade New York and New England.
Andrew Jackson; Battle of Horseshoe Bend(1814): This U.S. General fought this battle in present-day Alabama, and ended the power of an important British ally, the Creek nation. The victory eliminated the Indians and opened new lands to white settlers.
Battle of New Orleans (1815): This was a battle led by Andrew Jackson leading a force of frontier soldiers, free African Americans, and Creoles, halting the British effort to control the Mississippi River. However, this battle was pointless because the treaty ending the War of 1812 had already been signed two weeks earlier.
Treaty of Ghent (1814-1815): This treaty ended the War of 1812 and halted fighting, returned all conquered territory to the prewar claimant, and recognized the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States.

Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806): This was an expedition that began in St. Louis, crossed the Rockies, reached the Oregon coast on the Pacific Ocean, then turned back and completed the journey. This gave greater geographic and scientific knowledge of the region, stronger U.S. claims to the Oregon Territory, better relations with American Indians, and more accurate maps and land routes for fur trappers and future settlers.

Francis Scott Key; "The Star-Spangled Banner": This person wrote this poem after the British failed to take Baltimore because Fort McHenry held out after a night's bombardment.

~~Chapter 8: Nationalism and Economic Development, 1816-1848

Era of Good Feelings: This is the period when James Monroe was in office because his presidency was marked by a spirit of nationalism, optimism, and goodwill. In addition, there was only one political party at the time. However, there were many heated debates over tariffs, the national bank, internal improvements, and public land sales, as well as sectionalist tensions over slavery. Eventually, the Democratic-Republican party would be split into two.
James Monroe: This person was the 5th president

Tariff of 1816: This tariff raised taxes for the express purpose of protecting U.S. manufacturers from competition after American manufacturers feared that british goods would be dumped on American markets after the War of 1812.
Henry Clay; American System: This person created this system, which was a comprehensive method for advancing the nation's economic growth. His plan consisted of three part - (1) protective tariffs, (2) a national bank, and (3) internal improvement.
Panic of 1819: This was an economic panic caused by the Second Bank of the United States, after it tightened credit in a belated effort to control inflation. Many state banks closed and unemployment, bankruptcies, and imprisonment for debt increased sharply. The depression was most severe in the West, where many people were in debt because they speculated on land during the postwar euphoria.
Lancaster Turnpike (1790s): This road connected Philadelphia with the rich farmlands around Lancaster. Its success stimulated the construction of other privately built and relatively short toll roads that, by the mid-1820s, connected most of the country's major cities.
National (Cumberland) Road (1811-1850s): This was a paved highway and major route to the west extending more than a thousand miles from Maryland to Illinois. It used both federal and state money, with the different states receiving ownership of segments of the highway.
Erie Canal (1825): This canal linked the economies of western farms and eastern cities. The success of this canal in stimulating economic growth touched off a frenzy of canal-building in other states. Improved transportation meant lower food prices in the East, more immigrants settling in the West, and stronger economic ties between the two sections.
Robert Fulton; steamboats (1807): This person invented this type of boat, and successfully voyaged up the Hudson River. These boats eventually made round-trip shipping on the nation's great rivers both faster and cheaper.
Railroads: These were created in the 1820s, and in the 1830s competed directly with canals as an alternative method for carrying passengers and freight. These helped small western towns such as Cleveland, Cincinnati, Detroit, and Chicago turn into booming commercial centers of the expanding national economy.
Eli Whitney: This person is known for inventing the cotton gin in 1793, and devising a system for making rifles out of interchangeable parts during the War of 1812. Interchangeable parts then became the basis for mass production methods in the new northern factories.
Samuel Slater: This person brought with him the British secrets for building cotton-spinning machines, and put this knowledge to work by helping establish the first U.S. factory in 1791.
Lowell system: This was a system that recruited young farm women to work in textile mills and housed them in company dormitories. Many factories in the 1830s would imitate this system and eventually incorporate child labor, and later, immigrants in large numbers.
Unions: These were organized in major cities as early as the 1790s and increased in number as the factory system took hold. Many discontented factory workers would join these in order to reduce the workday to 10 hours. However, there were many obstacles, including (1) immigrant replacement workers, (2) state laws outlawing these, and (3) frequent economic depressions with high unemployment.
Cotton gin(1793): This transformed the agriculture of the whole south because now they could easily separate the cotton fiber from the seeds, which made southern planters find cotton more profitable than tobacco and indigo, the leading crops of the colonial period. This caused more slaves and new land to be bought, and more shipping to Britain's textile factories.
Market Revolution: This was a revolution for America, moving its economy away from agriculture, and more towards industrialization and modern capitalism. The farmers fed the workers in the cities, who in turn provided farm families with an array of mass-produced goods.

Fletcher v. Peck (1810): This was a court case involving land fraud in Georgia, and Marshall concluded that a state could not pass legislation invalidating a contract. This was the first time that the Supreme court declared a state law to be unconstitutional and invalid.
Martin v. Hunter's Lessee (1816): This was a court case where the Supreme court established that it had jurisdiction over state courts in cases involving constitutional rights.
Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819): This was a court case that involved a law of New Hampshire that changed Dartmouth College from a privately chartered college into a public institution. The Supreme court struck down the state law as unconstitutional, arguing that a contract for a private corporation could not be altered by the state.
McCulloch v. Maryland (1819): This was a court case where Maryland attempted to tax the Second Bank of the United States located in Maryland. Marshall ruled that a state could not tax a federal institution because "the power to tax is the power to destroy," and federal laws are supreme over state laws. In addition, this court case ruled that the National Bank was constitutional because even though no clause in the Constitution specifically mentions a national bank, the Constitution gave the federal government the implied power to create one.
Cohens v. Virginia (1821): This was a court case where a pair of brothers were convicted in Virginia of illegally selling lottery tickets for a lottery authorized by Congress for Washington, D.C.. Marshall and the court upheld the conviction, establishing the principle that the Supreme Court could review a state court's decision involving any of the powers of the federal government.
Gibbons v. Ogden (1821): This court case ruled that the state of New York could not grant a monopoly to a steamboat company if that action conflicted with a charter authorized by Congress. By ruling this unconstitutional, Marshall established the federal government's broad control of interstate commerce.
Tallmadge Amendment (1819): This was the start of the Missouri debate of whether it should be a free state or a slave state. It called for (1) prohibiting the further introduction of slaves into Missouri and (2) requiring the children of Missouri slaves to be emancipated at the age of 25.If adopted, this would have led to the gradual elimination of slavery in Missouri, but Southern states saw it as the first step in a northern effort to abolish slavery in all states.
Missouri Compromise (1820): This was a compromise by Henry Clay that (1) admitted Missouri as a slave-holding state, (2) admitted Maine as a free state, and (3) prohibited slavery in the rest of the Louisiana Territory north of latitude 36 degrees 30'.

Stephen Decatur: When problems with the Barbary pirates developed a second time, this person led a fleet in 1815 to force the rulers of North Africa to allow American shipping the free use of the Mediterranean.
Rush-Bagot Agreement (1817): This was when Britain and the United States agreed to strictly limit their naval armament on the Great Lakes. It would also place limits on border fortifications.
Treaty of 1818: This was a treaty between the United States and Britain that provided for (1) shared fishing rights off the coast of Newfoundland, (2) joint occupation of the Oregon Territory for 10 years, and the setting of the northern limits of the Louisiana Territory at the 49th parallel, thus establishing the western U.S.-Canada boundary line.
Florida Purchase Treaty / Adams-Onis Treaty (1819): This treaty was formed because Spain was worried that the United States would seize Florida after Jackson led a force of militia into Florida, destroying Seminole villages and capturing Pensacola, a Spanish city. Spain decided to get the best possible terms for Florida because it was also busy with troubles in Latin America. This treaty turned over all of its possessions in Florida and its own claims in the Oregon Territory to the United States, and in exchange, the United States agreed to assume $5 million in claims against Spain and give up any U.S. territorial claims to the Spanish province of Texas.
Monroe Doctrine (1823): This was created when Roger Canning, in his Canning proposal, asked the United States to form a joint Anglo-American warning to the European powers not to intervene in South America. However, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams believed that joint action with Britain would restrict U.S. opportunities for further expansion in the hemisphere, and JQA convinced Monroe to issue a statement to the world that did not have Britain as a coauthor because (1) if the United States acted alone, Britain could be counted upon the stand behind the U.S. policy and (2) no European power would risk going to war in South America, and if it did, the British navy would defeat the aggressor.

~~Chapter 9: Sectionalism, 1820-1860

Supreme Order of the Star-Spangled Banner: This was a secret antiforeign society filled with nativists who feared that the newcomers would take their jobs and also weaken the culture of the Anglo majority. Most nativists were Protestants who distrusted the Roman Catholicism practiced by the Irish and many of the Germans. This society eventually turned into the Know-Nothing Party, or the American party.
Planters: These were the rich southerners at the top of society. They owned at least 100 slaves and at least 1,000 acres. They maintained their power by dominating the state legislatures of the South and enacted laws that favored the large landholders' economic interests.
Codes of Chivalry: This was a code of chivalrous conduct, which included a strong sense of personal honor, the defense of womanhood, and paternalistic attitudes toward all who were deemed inferior, especially slaves.
Hillbillies: This was a nickname for poor whites in the South's population that could not afford the rich river-bottom farmland controlled by the planters, and many lived in the hills as subsistence farmers. Even though they had no slaves, they defended the slave system, thinking that someday they too could own slaves and that at least they were superior on the social scale to someone (slaves).
Mountain farmers: These were a number of small farmers that lived in frontier conditions in isolation from the rest of the South, along the slopes and valleys of the Appalachian and Ozark mountains. These people disliked the planters and their slaves. During the Civil War, many (including future president Andrew Johnson) would remain loyal to the Union.

Irish: This group of immigrants immigrated to the United States in massive groups due to a potato famine.
"Peculiar institution" / Gag Rule: This was another way of referring to slavery because some whites were sensitive about how they treated the other humans.
Denmark Vesey (1822); Nat Turner (1831): These two people led separate slave uprisings. The revolts were quickly and violently suppressed, but they still gave hope to enslaved African Americans, drove southern states to tighten their already strict slave codes, and demonstrated to many the evils of slavery.
Slave codes: These were sets of laws during the colonial period and in individual states after the American Revolution which defined the status of slaves and the rights and responsibilities of slave owners.
Code of Chivalry: This was a code of conduct for southern gentlemen which included a strong sense of personal honor, the defense of womanhood, and paternalistic attitudes toward all who were deemed inferior, especially slaves.

Commonwealth v. Hunt: This was a court case that ruled that "peaceful unions" had the right to negotiate labor contracts with employers.
Cyrus McCormick; John Deere: This person invented the mechanical reaper, and this other person invented the steel plow. These inventions made a farm family more efficient and allowed them to plant more acres, needing to supplement its labor only with a few hired workers at harvest time.

~~Chapter 10: The Age of Jackson, 1824-1844

Indian Removal Act (1830): This act forced the resettlement of many thousands of American Indians because Andrew Jackson thought the most humane solution was to compel the American Indians to leave their traditional homelands and resettle west of the Mississippi.
Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831): This court case ruled that Cherokees were not a foreign nation with the right to sue in a federal court after the Cherokees challenged Georgia in the courts because they didn't want to migrate west.
Worcester v. Georgia (1832): This court case ruled that the laws of Georgia had no force within Cherokee territory. However, President Jackson sided with the states, and the Court was powerless to enforce its decision without the President's support.
Cherokee Trail of Tears: This was when the U.S. army forced 15,000 Cherokees to leave Georgia. The hardships westward caused the deaths of over 4,000 Cherokees.

Nicholas Biddle: This person was the president of the Bank of the United States. His arrogance contributed to the suspicion that the bank abused its powers and served the interests of only the wealthy. When Henry Clay tried to recharter the bank in 1832, Jackson vetoed it, and won the election in 1832 with it.
Roger Taney: This was the Secretary of Treasury under President Jackson, and aided Jackson with attacking the Bank of the United States.
"Pet banks": These were a series of state banks that stored the federal funds of the National Bank of America that President Jackson withdrew.
Specie Circular: This was a presidential order that required all future purchases of federal lands to be made in gold and silver rather than in paper banknotes.
Panic of 1837: After Specie Circular was enacted, paper banknotes lost their value and land sales plummeted. Right after Jackson left office, this financial crisis plunged the nation's economy into a depression.
Martin Van Buren: This person was the 8th president of the United States and was elected because President Jackson persuaded the Democratic party to nominate his loyal vice president.

Universal white male suffrage (1816-1856): This was adopted first by Indiana (1816), Illinois (1818), and Missouri (1821), and later by eastern states. As a result, voting for the president rose from 350,000 in 1824 to more than 2.4 million in 1840. In addition, political offices could be held by people in the lower and middle ranks of society. In 1856, all states had this.
"King Caucus": This is a nickname for when candidates for office were nominated by a closed-door meeting of a political party's leaders in Congress. Common citizens had no opportunity to participate
Anti-Masonic party: This was the first political party to gather in a large meeting hall to nominate the party's candidates, a method that was more open to popular participation, hence more democratic. This party attacked the secret societies of Masons and accused them of belonging to a privileged, anti democratic elite.
Spoils system: This is a practice of dispensing government jobs in return for party loyalty.
Rotation in office: This was a practice by President Jackson, in which he limited a person to one term in office, so he could then appoint some other deserving Democrat in his place.
John Quincy Adams: This person was the 6th president of the United States.
"Corrupt bargain": This name was created about a secret political deal between President John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay after Andrew Jackson found out that Henry Clay used his influence in the House to provide JQA the presidency and then JQA made Henry Clay his secretary of state.
Tariff of 1828; "Tariff of abominations": This tariff was signed by President JQA and generally satisfied the northern manufacturers but alienated southern planters. Southerners nicknamed it this.
Revolution of 1828: This was when Andrew Jackson's party resorted to smearing the president and accusing Adams' wife of being born out of wedlock. Supporters of Adams retaliated in kind, accusing Jackson's wife of adultery. The mudslinging campaign attracted a lot of interest and voter turnout soared. In the end, Jackson won the Election of 1828, carrying every state west of the Appalachians.
Andrew Jackson: This person was the 7th president of the United States and represented the "common man" (working and middle class). He was an extraordinary ordinary man.
Peggy Eaton affair (1829-1831): This was when the wife of Jackson's secretary of war was targeted by a malicious gossip by other cabinet wives. When Jackson tried to force the cabinet wives to accept the secretary of war's wife, most of the cabinet resigned. This controversy eventually led to John c. Calhoun resigning a year later, and Martin Van Buren being elected due to his loyalty during this crisis.

~~Chapter 11: Society, Culture, and Reform, 1820-1860

Communal experiments: This was the idea of withdrawing from conventional society to create an ideal community, or utopia, in a fresh setting.
Shakers: This was one of the earliest religious communal movements, and had about 6,000 members in various communities by the 1840s. This society held property in common and kept women and men strictly separate (forbidding marriage and sexual relations). For lack of new recruits, this community virtually died out by the mid-1900s.
Amana Colonies: This was a communal experiment led by Germans who belonged to the religious reform movement known as Pietism. Like Shakers, they emphasized simple, communal living. However, they allowed for marriage, and their communities continue to prosper, although they no longer practice their communal ways of living.
Robert Owen; New Harmony: This person was the leader of this secular (nonreligious) experiment at this place. This person hoped his utopian socialist community would provide an answer to the problems of inequity and alienation caused by the Industrial Revolution. The experiment failed, however, as a result of both financial problems and disagreements among members of the community.
Joseph Henry Noyes; Oneida community (1848): This person started this cooperative community at this place. Dedicated to an ideal of perfect social and economic equality, community members shared property and, later, marriage partners. Critics attacked this community because of its system of planned reproduction and communal child-rearing as a sinful experiment in "free love."
Charles Fourier; Phalanxes: This person was a French socialist and attracted the interest of many Americans in this community. In response to the problems of a fiercely competitive society, this person advocated that people share work and housing in these communities. This movement died out quickly as Americans proved too individualistic to live communally.

Temperance: This movement was created because of the high rate of alcohol consumption (five gallons of hard liquor per person in 1820). It targeted alcohol as the cause of social ills, and explains why this became the most popular of the reform movements.
American Temperance Society (1826): This was founded by Protestant ministers and others concerned with drinking and its effects. It tried to persuade drinkers to take a pledge of total abstinence.
Washingtonians: This was formed when a group of recovering alcoholics argued that alcoholism was a disease that needed practical, helpful treatment.
Asylum movement: This was a movement created to help the increasing numbers of criminals, emotionally disturbed persons, and paupers. To alleviate the suffering of these individuals, reformers proposed setting up new public institutions -- state supported prisons, mental hospitals, and poorhouses. Reformers hoped that inmates would be cured as a result of being withdrawn from squalid surroundings and treated to a disciplined pattern of life in some rural setting.
Dorothea Dix: This person was a former schoolteacher from Massachusetts and was horrified to find mentally ill persons locked up with convicted criminals in unsanitary cells.

By the 1850s, special schools modeled after the work of these reformers had been established in many states of the Union.
Penitentiaries: These were new prisons to take the place of crude jails. Reformers placed prisoners in solitary confinement to force them to reflect on their sins and repent. The experiment was dropped because of the high rate of prisoner suicides. These prison reforms reflected a major doctrine of the asylum movement - structure and discipline would bring about moral reform.
Auburn system: This was a penal experiment in New York that enforced rigid rules of discipline while also providing moral instruction and work programs.
Horace Mann: This person was the leading advocate of the common (public) school movement.

He argued for "no Union with slaveholders" until they repented for their sins by freeing their slaves.
Liberty party (1840): This party was split off of the American Anti-slavery Society because they thought William Lloyd Garrison was too radical. A group of northerners formed this party because they thought political action was a more practical route to reform than Garrison's moral crusade. They ran James birney as their candidate for president with their one campaign pledge being to bring about the end of slavery by political and legal means.
Frederick Douglass; The North Star: This person was a former slave and spoke about the brutality and degradation of slavery from firsthand experience. He wrote this journal, and advocated both political and direct action to end slavery and racial prejudice.

This movement was expressed in the United States by transcendentalists, a small group of New England thinkers.
Transcendentalists: This group of people questioned the doctrines of established churches and the business practices of the merchant class. They argued for a mystical and intuitive way of thinking as a means for discovering one's inner self and looking for the essence of God in nature. Their views challenged the materialism of American society by suggesting that artistic expression was more important than the pursuit of wealth.
Ralph Waldo Emerson: This person was the best-known transcendentalist and was a very popular American speaker. His essays and lectures expressed the individualistic and nationalistic spirit of Americans by urging them not to imitate European culture but to create a distinctive American culture.

He would become a leading critic of slavery in the 1850s and then an ardent supporter of the Union during the civil war.
Henry David Thoreau, "On Civil Disobedience": This person was a transcendentalist who conducted a two-year experiment of living simply in a cabin in the woods outside of town. He used observations of nature to discover essential truths about life and the universe. He wrote this essay, where he established himself as an early advocate of nonviolent protest. His essay presented his argument for disobeying unjust laws and accepting the penalty. He followed through with his beliefs when he refused to pay a tax that would support an action he considered immoral - the U.S. war with Mexico (1846-1848). He would eventually inspire nonviolent movements such as Gandhi in India and Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States.

It caused new divisions in society between the newer, evangelical sects and the older Protestant churches.
Timothy Dwight: This person was the president of Yale College in Connecticut, and motivated a generation of young men to become evangelical preachers. He was one of the people who started the Second Great Awakening

Because of his influence, western New York became known as the "burned-over district".
Millennialism; William Miller: This was the belief that the world was about to end with the second coming of Jesus.

It hired thousands of people in one of the nation's poorest regions to build dams, operate electric power plants, control flooding and erosion, and manufacture fertilizer. It sold electricity to residents of the region at rates that were well below those previously charged by a private power company.
National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) (1933): (Title I) This First New Deal program was an attempt to guarantee reasonable profits for business and fair wages and hours for labor.

National Labor Relations (Wagner) Act (1935): This Second New Deal act replaced the labor provisions of the National Industrial Recovery act, after that law was declared unconstitutional. It set up the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which guaranteed a worker's right to join a union and a union's right to bargain collectively. It also outlawed business practices that were unfair to labor.
Social Security Act (1935): This Second New Deal act created a federal based insurance program based upon the automatic collection of payments from employees and employers throughout people's working careers. This fund would then be used to make monthly payments to retired persons over the age of 65.

It also loaned more than $1 billion to farmers and set up camps for migrant workers. Temporary housing for Dust Bowl refugees from whom migrated to California was also established.
Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) (1938): This Second New Deal act was enacted as an alternative and replacement for the farm subsidy policies, in the previous AAA that was declared unconstitutional. This act revived the provisions in the previous AAA, with the exception that the financing of the law's programs would be provided by the federal government and not a processor's tax, and was also enforced as a response to the success of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936.
Keynesian Economics: This is the act of engaging in deficit spending to bring an economy out of depression. Deficit spending is massive government spending, in excess of revenue, raised by borrowing rather than from taxation.

It proposed that the president be authorized to appoint to the Supreme Court an additional justice for each current justice who was older than a certain age (70 + 1/2 years). This would have allowed FDR to add up to six more justices to the Court -- all of them presumably of liberal persuasion.

Operation Wetback (1954): This operation was when U.S. officials, responding to complaints from native-born workers and from Mexico, forced an estimated 3.8 million people to return to Mexico.

The Lonely Crowd (1958): This book was published by Harvard sociologist David Riesman and criticized the "inner-directed" individuals in society with "other-directed" conformists.
The Affluent Society (1958): This book was written by economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who wrote about the failure of wealthy Americans to address the need for increased social spending for the common good.
The Catcher in the Rye (1951): This book was written by J.D. Salinger and provided classic commentary on "phoniness" as viewed by a troubled teenager.
Catch-22 (1961): This book, written by Joseph Heller, satirized the stupidity of the military and war.
Beatniks (1950): This was a group of rebellious writers and intellectuals led by Jack Kerouac and poet Allen Ginsberg. They advocated spontaneity, use of drugs, and rebellion against societal standards. They would become models for the youth rebellion of the 1960s.

~~Chapter 28: Promise and Turmoil, The 1960s

John F. Kennedy (JFK) (1960-1963): This person was the 35th president and was a charismatic, wealthy, and youthful 43-year-old senator from Massachusetts. He won because of he was better looking and his debates were televised, while Nixon seemed nervous and sweaty.
New Frontier: This was the domestic and foreign policy of John F. Kennedy, who called for aid to education, federal support of health care, urban renewal, and civil rights, but was shot down in Congress. Most were passed later under President Johnson. In addition, he stimulated the economy by increasing spending for defense and space exploration, as he committed the nation to land on the moon by the end of the decade.
Assassination in Dallas (1963): At this place, John F. Kennedy was assassinated as two bullets from Lee Harvey-Oswald found their mark.
Warren Commission: This commission concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin and was headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren.

Peace Corps (1961): This was an organization that recruited young American volunteers to provide labor to help third world countries improve the infrastructure, health care, and education.
Alliance for progress (1961): This promoted land reform and economic development in Latin America. Its goal was to close the gap between the rich and the poor, deterring Communism by providing economic aid. It's similar to the Marshall Plan (1947).
Trade Expansion Act (1962): This act authorized tariff reductions with the recently formed EEC - European Economic Community (Common Market) of Western European nations (which would become the European Union).
Bay of Pigs Invasion (1961): This was when Kennedy approved a CIA scheme to use Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. Cubans landed at this place but failed to set off a general uprising as planned. Trapped by a coral reef, the anti-Castro Cubans had little choice but to surrender after Kennedy rejected the idea of using U.S. forces to save them.
Berlin Wall (1961): This was when East Germans, with Soviet backing, built a wall around West Berlin. Its purpose was to stop East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. It stood as a gloomy symbol of the Cold War until it was torn down by rebellious East Germans in 1989.
Cuban missile crisis (1962): This was when U.S. reconnaissance planes discovered that the Russians were building underground sites in Cuba for the launching of offensive missiles that could reach the United States in minutes. Kennedy responded by announcing to the world that he was setting up a naval blockade of Cuba until the weapons were removed. Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba in exchange for Kennedy's public pledge not to invade the island nation and to later secretly remove U.S. Jupiter missiles from Turkey.
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963): This treaty ended the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere.This first step in controlling the testing of nuclear arms was offset by a new round in the arms race for developing missile and warhead superiority.
Flexible response: This is a foreign policy that involves increasing spending on conventional (non-nuclear) arms and mobile military forces because nuclear weapons weren't very effective in stopping brushfire wars in 3rd world countries. While this policy reduced the risk of using nuclear weapons, it also increased the temptation to send elite special forces, such as the Green Berets, into combat all over the globe.

Lyndon Johnson (LBJ) (1963-1969): This person was the 36th president. As a native of rural west Texas and a graduate of a little-known teacher's college, he seemed very unsophisticated compared to the wealthy, Harvard-educated Kennedy. On the other hand, he was a skilled politician who had started his career as a devoted Roosevelt Democrat during the Great Depression.
Great Society: This was the domestic program under President Lyndon Johnson that instituted federally sponsored social welfare programs. President Johnson persuaded Congress to pass (1) an expanded version of Kennedy's civil rights bill, and (2) Kennedy's proposal for an income tax cut. The programs also increased funding for mass transit, public housing, rent subsidies for low-income people, and crime prevention.
*The Other America* (1962): This book was written by Michael Harrington and helped to focus national attention on the 40 million Americans still living in poverty. President Johnson responded by declaring 2 years later an "unconditional war on poverty."
Election of 1964: This was an election between Lyndon Johnson with his running mate, Senator Hubert Humphrey, with a clearly liberal agenda, and a staunch conservative, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who advocated ending the welfare state, including TVA and Social Security. A TV ad by the Democrats pictured Goldwater as a dangerous extremist, who would be quick to involve the United States in nuclear war. However, the doomed Goldwater campaign did energize young conservatives and introduced new conservative voices, such as former film actor and TV host, Ronald Reagan of California.
Economic Opportunity Act of 1964: This Great Society act created the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which provided a billion-dollar budget and sponsored a wide variety of self-help programs for the poor, such as Head Start for preschoolers, which was a program of the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families, the Job Corps for vocational education, literacy programs, and legal services. The controversial Community Action Program allowed the poor to run anti-poverty programs in their own neighborhoods. It also created VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America), an anti-poverty program as the domestic version of the Peace Corps. Initially, VISTA increased employment opportunities for conscientious people who felt they could contribute tangibly to the War on Poverty. Volunteers served in communities throughout the U.S., focusing on enriching educational programs and vocational training for the nation's underprivileged classes.
Food Stamp Act (1964): This Great Society act expanded the federal program to help poor people buy food. It created the Food Stamp Program.
Wilderness Act of 1964 / Wilderness Preservation Act: This Great Society act created the legal definition of wilderness in the United States and protected 9.1 million acres of federal land. It was the result of a long effort to protect federal wilderness and to create a formal mechanism for designating wilderness.

National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities (1965): This Great Society program provided federal funding for the arts and for creative and scholarly projects. It created the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a separate one for Arts. The humanities endowment was dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities. The arts endowment offered support and funding for projects exhibiting artistic excellence.
Medical Care Act of 1965: This Great Society act created Medicare, a program that provided health insurance for all people 65 and older, and Medicaid, a program that provided funds to states to pay for medical care for the poor and disabled.
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965): This Great Society act provided federal funds to poor school districts, funds for special education programs, and funds to expand Head Start, an early childhood education program.
Higher Education Act (1965): This Great Society act intended "to strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and higher education". It increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans for students, and established the National Teachers Corps.
Immigration Act / Immigration and Nationality Act / Hart-Celler Act (1965) / Immigration Bill: This Great Society act abolished discriminatory quotas based on national origins. It marked a change from past U.S. policy which had discriminated against non-northern Europeans. In removing racial and national barriers, it would significantly and unintentionally alter the demographic mix in the U.S.
Child Nutrition Act (1966): This Great Society act was created as a result of the "years of cumulative successful experience under the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to help meet the nutritional needs of children." This act also established the School Breakfast Program, a federally assisted meal program that provides low-cost or free breakfasts to children in public and non-profit schools as well as child care institutions.
FLSA (1938) amendment; Minimum Wage Act (1966): This Great Society act/amendment expanded coverage of that act to some farm workers and increased the minimum wage to $1.60 per hour in stages. It also gave state and local government employees coverage for the first time.

Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964: This Great Society act provided $375 million for large-scale urban public or private rail projects in the form of matching funds to cities and states. This also created the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (now the Federal Transit Administration), which provided capital grants for up to 50% of the cost of transit improvements.
Omnibus Housing Act of 1964: This Great Society act provided federal funds to build housing for poor and middle-income families and established a rent-supplement program for them.
Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965: This Great Society act was a major revision to federal housing policy in the United States and instituted several major expansions in federal housing programs. This greatly expanded funding for existing federal housing programs, and added new programs to provide rent subsidies for the elderly and disabled, housing rehabilitation grants to poor homeowners, provisions for veterans to make very low down-payments to obtain mortgages, new authority for families qualifying for public housing to be placed in empty private housing (along with subsidies to landlords), and matching grants to localities for the construction of water and sewer facilities, construction of community centers in low-income areas, and urban beautification.

Department of Transportation (DOT) (1966): This is a federal Cabinet department of the U.S. government concerned with transportation.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (1965): This is a Cabinet department in the Executive branch of the federal government. It was founded to develop and execute policies on housing and metropolises.
*Unsafe at Any Speed*: This book was written by Ralph Nader and caused response by Congress to pass regulations of the automobile industry that would save hundreds of thousands of lives in the following years.
*Silent Spring*: This book was written by Rachel Carson and caused Congress to enact clean air and water laws due to the danger of pesticides.
Lady Bird Johnson: This nickname was given to the wife of President Lyndon Johnson who contributed to improving the environment with her Beautify American campaign, which resulted in the Highway Beautification Act (1965) that removed billboards from federal roads.
Civil Rights Act of 1964: This act made segregation illegal in all public facilities, including hotels and restaurants, and gave the federal government additional powers to enforce school desegregation. This act also set up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to end discrimination in employment the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.
24th Amendment (1964): This amendment abolished the practice of collecting a poll tax, one of the measures that, for decades, had discouraged poor people from voting.
Voting Rights Act of 1965: This act was ended literacy tests and provided federal registrars in areas where blacks were kept from voting. It was caused by the (March to Montgomery (1965)), which included killings and brutality in Selma, Alabama, against the voting rights marches led by Martin Luther King Jr. The impact was most dramatic in the Deep South, where African Americans could vote for the first time since the Reconstruction era.

Integration of Ole Miss (1962): This was when James Meredith, a young African American air force veteran, attempted to enroll in University of Mississippi. He was stopped by the governor of Mississippi, but a federal court guaranteed his right to attend. Supporting Meredith and the court order, President Kennedy sent in 400 federal marshals and 3,000 troops to control mob violence and protect Meredith's right to attend class. A similar case involving governor George Wallace of Alabama occurred at the University of Alabama, and was stopped by Kennedy as well (1963).
Birmingham Campaign (1963): This was when Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) organized a nonviolent direct action protest. However, it was a law at this place that you can't protest, so MLK and many other African Americans were jailed. This proved to be a milestone in the civil rights movement because most Americans believed King was jailed unjustly.
"Letter From Birmingham Jail" (1963): This letter defends the strategy of nonviolent resistance to racism. In it, MLK defends nonviolent direct action. He is protesting because he collected facts to determine if injustices exist -- and they did --, he tried negotiating -- which didn't work --, he believes in self purification, which means the cleansing of anger, selfishness, and violent attitudes from the heart and soul, for their rights.
March on Washington (1963): This was a march led by Martin Luther King and A. Philip Randolph and was one of the largest and most successful demonstrations in U.S. history. About 200,000 blacks and whites took part in this peaceful protest in support of the civil rights bill. It argued for economic opportunities, such as fair housing, desegregated schools, employment rights, and voting rights.
March to Montgomery (1965): This was a voting rights march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery. It was met with beatings and tear gas in what became known as "Bloody Sunday". Televised pictures of the violence proved a turning point in the civil rights movement. The national outrage moved President Johnson to send federal troops to protect King and other marchers in another attempt to petition the state government. This caused the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Nevertheless, young African Americans were losing patience with the slow progress toward equality and the continued violence against their people by white extremists.
Black Muslims: This was a movement led by Elijah Muhammad who was seeking a new cultural identity based on Africa and Islam. The movement preached black nationalism, separatism, and self-improvement, and had attracted thousands of followers. One of its most controversial leaders would become Malcolm X.
Malcolm X: This person became a convert while serving in prison and adopted this name. Leaving prison in 1952, this person acquired a reputation as the Black Muslims' most controversial voice. He criticized Martin Luther King Jr. as "an Uncle Tom" (subservient to whites) and advocated self-defense -- using black violence to counter white violence. He eventually left the Black Muslims and moved away from defending violence, but was assassinated by black opponents in 1965. *The Autobiography of (this person)* remains an engaging testimony to one man's development from a petty criminal into a major leader.
Black Panthers: This was an organization created by Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, and other militants as a revolutionary socialist movement advocating self-rule for American blacks.
Watts riot; race riots (1965-1968): These were riots due to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It involved the arrest of a young black motorist by white police in this black neighborhood in Los Angeles and a six-day race riot that killed 34 people and destroyed over 700 buildings. These riots continued to erupt each summer in black neighborhoods of major cities with increasing casualties and destruction of property. Rioters shouted slogans such as "Burn baby, burn" and "Get whitey".
Kerner Commission (1967): This was a federal commission investigated the causes of the race riots in Watts and other cities. They concluded that racism and segregation were chiefly responsible and that the United States was becoming "two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal."
Martin Luther King Jr.'s (MLK's) assassination (1968): This person, while standing on a motel balcony in Memphis, Tennessee had been shot and killed by a white man. This caused massive riots in 168 cities across the country, leaving at least 46 people dead. The violence did not reflect the ideals of the murdered leader, but it did reveal the anger and frustrations among African Americans in both the North and the South. The violence also fed a growing "white backlash," especially among white blue-collar voters, to the civil rights movement, which was soon reflected in election results.
Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act): This act prohibited housing discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, and sex. It is loosely enforced by the Department of H.U.D.

Loving v. VA (1967): This court case legalized interracial marriage.
Mapp v. Ohio (1961): This court case ruled that illegally seized evidence cannot be used in court against the accused.
Gideon v. Wainwright (1963): This court case required that state courts provide counsel (services of an attorney) for indigent (poor) defendants.
Escobedo v. Illinois (1964): This court case required the police to inform an arrested person of his or her right to remain silent.
Miranda v. Arizona (1966): This court case extended the ruling in Escobedo v. Illinois to include the right to a lawyer being present during questioning by the police.
Baker v. Carr (1962): This court case declared state legislature that had districts that strongly favored rural areas to the disadvantage of cities unconstitutional.
"One man, one vote": This was a Supreme Court principle that meant that election districts would have to be redrawn to provide equal representation for all citizens.
Yates v. United States (1957): This court case said that the 1st Amendment protected radical and revolutionary speech, even by Communists, unless it was a "clear and present danger" to the safety of the country.
Engel v. Vitale (1962): This court case ruled that state laws requiring prayers and Bible readings in the public schools violated the 1st Amendment's provision for separation of church and state.
Griswold v. Connecticut (1965): This court case ruled that, in recognition of a citizen's right to privacy, a state could not prohibit the use of contraceptives by adults. (This privacy case provided the foundation for later cases establishing a woman's right ot an abortion.)

Students for a Democratic Society (1962): This was a newly formed radical organization that held a meeting in Port Huron, Michigan. Following the leadership of Tom Hayden, this group issued a declaration of purposes known as the Port Huron Statement, which called for university decisions to be made through participatory democracy, so that students would have a voice in decisions affecting their lives. This group was formed because various liberal groups began to identify with blacks' struggle against oppressive controls and laws.
New Left: This would become activists and intellectuals who supported the idea of participatory democracy and follow the Students for a Democratic Society.
Weathermen: This was the most radical fringe of the Students for a Democratic Society, which embraced violence and vandalism in their attacks on American institutions. In the eyes of most Americans, this group's extremist acts and language discredited the early idealism of the New Left.
Counterculture / Cultural Movement: This was the general term that was expressed by young people in rebellious styles of dress, music, drug use, and, for some, communal living. The apparent dress code of the "hippies" and "flower children" of the 1960s included long hair, beards, beads, and jeans. The folk music of Joan Baez and Bob Dylan gave voice to the younger generation's protests, which the rock music of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison, and Janis Joplin provided the beat and lyrics for this. However, as a result of experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD or becoming addicted to various other drugs, some young people destroyed their lives. This' excesses and economic uncertainties of the times led to this' demise in the 1970s.
Woodstock (1969): This was a gathering of over 400,000 young people at this Music Festival in upper New York State reflected the zenith/pinnacle of counterculture / the cultural movement.
Alfred Kinsey: This person challenged traditional beliefs about sexual conduct in the late 1940s and 1950s. His research indicated that premarital sex, marital infidelity, and homosexuality were more common than anyone had suspected.
Sexual revolution: This was a change in Americans' attitudes toward sexual expression. Medicine (antibiotics for venereal disease) and science (the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960) contributed to changing attitudes about engaging in casual sex with a number of partners. In the 1980s many would blame this for the increase in illegitimate births, especially among teenagers, an increase in rape and sexual abuse, and the spread of a deadly new disease, AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).
*The Feminine Mystique* (1963): This book was written by Betty Friedan and gave the women's movement a new direction by encouraging middle-class women to seek fulfillment in professional careers in addition to filling the roles of wife, mother, and homemaker.
National Organization for Women (NOW) (1966): This organization, founded with help from Betty Friedan, adopted the activist tactics of other civil rights movements to secure equal treatment of women, especially for job opportunities.
Equal Pay Act (1963): This act prohibited discrimination in compensation on the basis of gender, but had been poorly enforced.
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) (1972): This amendment was a major legislative victory for feminists and was passed by Congress and stated "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex." Although NOW and other groups campaigned hard for the ratification of this amendment, it just missed acceptance by the required 38 states. It was defeated in part because of a growing reaction against feminism by conservatives who feared the movement threatened the traditional roles of women.

Stonewall Riots (1969): These were riots on behalf of the LGBT community. It was caused when a gay bar sold liquor without a liquor license, and the police came in very forcefully and brutally attacked the gay patrons. Side note - the American Psychological Association said that homosexuality was a disorder at the time.
United Farm Workers (1962): This was a labor union for Mexican farm workers. They protested and marched to Sacramento, California, which drew national attention that these Mexican migrant workers were being oppressed by their employees. In 1970, employers gave new contracts and allowed collective bargaining rights for this union. It was led by Cesar Chavez, who pressured workers in the South to help Mexican farm workers with new contracts that involved higher wages.


Tonkin Gulf Resolution / Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964): This resolution gave the president, as commander in chief, a blank check to take "all necessary measures" to protect U.S. interests in Vietnam.
Six-Day War (1967): This was a war fought between Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. It resulted with Israel winning and capturing the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank, Old City of Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.
Credibility gap: This was created because of misinformation from military and civilian leaders combined with President Johnson's reluctance to speak frankly with the American people about the scope and the costs of the war. President Johnson always hoped that a little more military pressure would bring the North Vietnamese to the peace table, but he failed to understand both the enemy and the nature of the war.
Hawks: These were the supporters of the Vietnam War. They believed that the war was an act of Soviet-backed Communist aggression against South Vietnam and that it was part of a master plan to conquer all of Southeast Asia.
Doves: These people were against the Vietnam War. They viewed the conflict as a civil war fought by Vietnamese nationalists and some Communists who wanted to unite their country by overthrowing a corrupt Saigon (, capital of South Vietnam) government.
Operation Rolling Thunder (1965-68): This was a strategic bombing campaign by the U.S. air force that attacked industrial and military targets throughout North Vietnam. One of their main targets was the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which started in North Vietnam, goes through Laos, and then into South Vietnam, and was the Communist main supply line..
Tet Offensive (1968): This was an all-out surprise attack on almost every provincial capital and American base in South Vietnam. Although the attack took a fearful toll in the cities, the U.S. military counterattacked, inflicted much heavier losses on the Vietcong, and recovered the lost territory. Even so, in political terms, the American military victory proved irrelevant to the way this was interpreted at home. The destruction viewed by millions on the TV news appeared as a colossal setback for Johnson's Vietnam policy. Thus, for the Vietcong and North Vietnamese, this was a tremendous political victory in demoralizing the American public.


Eugene McCarthy: This person was the leader of the anti-war movement of Vietnam. He was the from Minnesota and became the first anti-war advocate to challenge Johnson for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination
Robert F. Kennedy: This person was the attorney general under John F. Kennedy and made sure that African Americans were protected while also appealing the southern Democrats. He was a senator from New York and entered the presidential race, but was killed after his victory speech after he won in California's primary. He was shot and killed by a young Arab nationalist who opposed Kennedy's support for Israel.
Hubert Humphrey: This person was the vice president under President Johnson. He decided to run for the election of 1968 at the Chicago Convention, but was thwarted by anti-war demonstrators who started a "police riot." This left this person as the nominee of a badly divided Democratic party, and early polls showed he was a clear underdog in a nation sick of disorder and protest.
George Wallace: This person channeled growing hostility of many whites to federal desegregation, anti-war protests, and race riots. He was the first politician of late-20th-century America to marshal the general resentment against the Washington establishment ("pointy-head liberals," as he called them) and the two party system. He ran for president as the self-nominated candidate of the American Independent party, hoping to win enough electoral votes to throw the election into the House of Representatives.
Richard Nixon: This person was the Republican candidate in the election of 1968 and the 37th president. He was a "hawk" on the Vietnam War and ran on the slogans of "peace with honor" and "law and order."
