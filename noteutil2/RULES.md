# NoteUtil Rules:

## Writing Notes:
When typing your notes, it is essential that you follow these guidelines so that NoteUtil can comprehend your notes
    with as few bugs as possible. 
The following rules dictate a few requirements for your notes:

1. Each line must be separated by a newline (what you get by pressing enter)
2. If you intend for a line to become a *pair*, it must have only one *separator*
3. If you want a line to be ignored, you must start the line with whatever you put for *Comments* in the Config file.
