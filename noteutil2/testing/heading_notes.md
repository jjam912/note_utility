# Discrete Mathematics

This is maths!

Maths is very fun: Yes, I do like!

## 1. Logic and Proofs

This sentence is false.

If this sentence is false: Am I lying?

### 1.1 Propositional Logic
A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.

Propositional Variables: Letters to denote propositions.

Atomic Propositions: Propositions that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions.

New propositions called compound propositions are formed from existing propositions using logical operators or connectives.

### 1.2 Applications of Propositional Logic

Propositional logic can be applied to the design of computer hardware.

Logic Circuit: These receive input signals, each a bit (0 meaning off and 1 meaning on)

Inverter: This logic circuit takes an input p and produces output !p.

The AND gate takes the inputs p and q, each a bit, and produces as output the signal (p ^ q)

## 2. Basic Structures: Sets, Functions, Sequences, Sums, and Matrices

Sets are cool.

Functions: Maybe

### 2.1 Sets

Some set definition

I don't know: Sets are like bins

### 2.2 Set Operations

The past tense of Yeet: Yeeted 
The past tense of Yeet: Yote
