Middle Ages; "Dark Ages": This is a 600 year block of time (750-1350) outside the Roman Empire. {The most notable person during this time is Charlemagne, who united Europe under Catholicism, father of the Holy Roman Empire.} During this time, there was no political, economic, social structural, or developmental evolution. Potential causes of this stagnation could include Europe being rural at the time, the Catholic church controlling everything, and people being content with their lives.
3 Major Causes of the Renaissance: Famine (1315) -> Pandemic and Bubonic Plague, War -> Political shift, and the fall of the Church.
Little Ice Age (LIA) (1315-1317): This famine caused about 10% of the European population to die. This was caused by such a great climate change (colder) that growing crops became impossible. This caused up to 13% of the European population to go back to urban centers for opportunities and relief.
